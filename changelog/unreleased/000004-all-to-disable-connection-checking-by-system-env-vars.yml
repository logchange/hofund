title: Allow disabling connection checks for specific targets using environment variables. Set environment variable named `HOFUND_CONNECTION_<TARGET>_DISABLED` (where `<TARGET>` is the uppercase value of the target name) is set to either `true` (case-insensitive) or `1`. For example, to disable connection checks for a target named "payment-api", you would set the environment variable `HOFUND_CONNECTION_PAYMENT_API_DISABLED=true`.
