- [pronunciation in Old Norse](https://forvo.com/word/h%C7%ABfu%C3%B0/) also you can pronunce it as`ho` `fund`
- is a tool set to monitor applications, connections and discover current state of components of the system

```
H«´fu√∞ ("man-head," Norwegian hoved, Danish hoved, Swedish huvud and Icelandic h√∂fu√∞) 
is the sword of Heimdallr.

"Where‚Äôs the sword? That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost." ‚Äï Hela

Hofund, often simply referred as the Bifrost Sword, was an Asgardian sword used 
by Heimdall and, during his exile, Skurge. 
It also served as a key to activate the switch that opens the Bifrost Bridge.

# Compatibility

|  Version  |           SpringBoot Version            |
|:---------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| **0.X.0** | from **2.2.0** (including 3.0.0 and up) |

# Requirements

You can check following requirements by running `mvn dependency:tree`, but if you are using `spring-boot` in version at
least `2.2.0` everything should be alright.

Your project has to contain:

- spring-framework in version at least 5.2.12.RELEASE
- spring-boot in version at least 2.2.0
- micrometer-io in version at least 1.3.0
- slf4j in version at least 1.7.28

# Usage

## SpringBoot based projects

### 1. Add to your pom.xml:

```xml
<project>
   ...
   <dependencies>
      ...
       <dependency>
           <groupId>dev.logchange.hofund</groupId>
           <artifactId>hofund-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
           <version>0.3.0</version>
       </dependency>
      ...
   </dependencies>
   
   <build>
       ...
       <plugins>
          ...
          <plugin>
             <!-- For multi-module projects this plugin should be in module which produce final package (.jar/.war/.ear)  -->
             <groupId>pl.project13.maven</groupId>
             <artifactId>git-commit-id-plugin</artifactId>
             <version>4.9.10</version> <!-- for java 11 you can use 5.0.0 (https://github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin#relocation-of-the-project) -->
             <configuration>
                <failOnNoGitDirectory>false</failOnNoGitDirectory>
                <injectAllReactorProjects>true</injectAllReactorProjects>
             </configuration>
          </plugin>
          ...
       </plugins>
       ...
   </build>
   ...
</project>
```

### 2. Check if your project already contains SpringBoot Actuator with Micrometer or add it:

```xml

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

And your application should have the following configuration:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus
```

or

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "prometheus"
```

To define basic information about our application in hofund metric we need some configuration.
For maven project add to your `application.properties` following entries, but you can define it as you wish:

```properties
hofund.info.application.name=@project.name@
hofund.info.application.version=@project.version@

hofund.git-info.commit.id=@git.commit.id@
hofund.git-info.commit.id-abbrev=@git.commit.id.abbrev@
hofund.git-info.dirty=@git.dirty@
hofund.git-info.branch=@git.branch@
hofund.git-info.build.host=@git.build.host@
hofund.git-info.build.time=@git.build.time@
```

or

```yaml
hofund:
  info:
    application:
      name: @project.name@
      version: @project.version@
  git-info:
    commit:
      id: @git.commit.id@
      id-abbrev: @git.commit.id.abbrev@
    dirty: @git.dirty@
    branch: @git.branch@
    build:
      host: @git.build.host@
      time: @git.build.time@
```

### 3. Now you can start your application and verify exposed prometheus metric:

```text
# HELP hofund_info Basic information about application
# TYPE hofund_info gauge
hofund_info{application_name="cart",application_version="1.0.4-SNAPSHOT",id="cart",} 1.0
# HELP hofund_connection Current status of given connection
# TYPE hofund_connection gauge
hofund_connection{id="cart-cart_database",source="cart",target="cart_database",type="database",} 1.0
# HELP hofund_git_info Basic information about application based on git
# TYPE hofund_git_info gauge
hofund_git_info{branch="master",build_host="DESKTOP-AAAAA",build_time="2023-02-19T11:22:34+0100",commit_id="0d32d0f",dirty="true",} 1.0
```

### 4. Metrics description

   - `hofund_info` - used to detect if application is running and what version is used. Application name and id
     in the metric is always lowercase to make easier creation of connection graph.

   - `hofund_connection` - used to examine connection status to given services such as databases, rest apis etc.
     Source is a name of the current application (lowercase) and target is a name of service that we want to connect
     to joint with target type(also lowercase). Id is created by joining this two properties.

   - `hofund_git_info` - used to inform about build and git-based information such as: commit id(short),
     dirtiness(dirty - uncommitted changes), build machine name and time, branch. This information is useful
     for sandbox environments, where everything is changing really fast.

### 5. Currently supported spring datasource's for auto-detection and providing `hofund_connection`:
    - PostgreSQL
    - Oracle
